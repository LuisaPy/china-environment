# Topic Analysis&#8212;Contingency Matrix

The contingency matrix script proposes to visualize the joint distribution of the top 200 terms that we derived (after parsing all the data from all chosen Chinese news sources) and the news sources themselves. The aim is to see which news outlets cover what environmental topics based on the frequency of the terms. 





The contingency matrix shows the degree of correlation between the pairs. The red cells, which show the most correlation as we see in this graph is air pollution and air quality in the South China Morning Post. But if we look at air quality and air pollution in China daily, the correlation is dark blue, which means that there is little to no correlation between this term/topic and this newspaper source. Considering that it is the main source of news outlet in China, it is quite skeptical that there is no mention of air pollution or air quality. The other news sources like South China People’s Daily, also has little to no mention of air quality and air pollution, while Shanghai Daily has a higher correlation but not too high. Finally, Global Times has a higher correlation (more orange).
What is even more interesting is the term ‘environmental protection’. There is very little correlation between this term and South China Morning Post, but a way higher (almost dark orange) correlation when it comes to China daily. This is interesting because China Morning Post frequently mention environmental protection but exclude ‘air pollution’ and ‘air quality’ from the equation!!
