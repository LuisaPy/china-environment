># Sources and Methodology

>In order to analyze and compare discourse on climate change in Chinese media, we used Factiva database in order to collect over 16,000 articles from January of 2017 to October of 2017. Our mainland sources include China Daily, Shanghai Daily, Global Times, and People’s Daily, and, our Hong-Kong-based source is South China Morning Post. In order to reduce noise and target our research to analyzing how climate change has been discussed in environmental context, we limited the scope of articles based on their ‘Subjects’ on Factiva. As described below, we narrowed the article subjects down to, for example, ‘Air/Water/Land Quality’ and ‘Natural Environment’. In analyzing the corpa consisting of these articles, we have used various digital methods using the [Cortext](http://www.cortext.net) platform, including demography analysis, network mapping, topic modeling, and contingency matrix.
