<b>Comparison of Newspapers - A Criticality Index<b>

When thinking about how different Chinese newspapers treat the environment, one question that readily comes to mind is to which degree a source criticizes government. We decided to develop an exemplary indicator, which can serve to compare the criticality of sources. 

We assume that a proxy to government criticism is the number of times a source mentions issues like smog, death, corruption and censorship. We then normalized the occurrences to calculate how many times these issues are mentioned each 100 articles.
