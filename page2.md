| “Pig carcass furore still raising worries”         | “Water safe despite carcasses”      |
| Reason for carcasses not clear                     | Shanghai’s authorities have guaranteed the quality of the city’s drinking water|
| Government lacked explanation-suspicious!          | Dead pigs were removed, polluted stream did not affect the water |
| Government’s publicity campaign                    | Reason uncertain, but pigs were too young and probably died of a virus   |
