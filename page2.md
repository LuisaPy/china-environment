> PROVIDE DETAILS OF THE APPROACH HERE! Here is the example of what I wrote for Topic Modeling: The technique was developed by [David Blei](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/) and others. The [Journal of Digital Humanities](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-a-basic-introduction-by-megan-r-brett/) has prepared an introductory article on topic modeling, which features this short definition: <i>"Topic modeling is a form of text mining, a way of identifying patterns in a corpus. You take your corpus and run it through a tool which groups words across the corpus into ‘topics’. Miriam Posner has described topic modeling as “a method for finding and tracing clusters of words (called “topics” in shorthand) in large bodies of texts."</i> We ran Cortext's [Topic Modeling](https://docs.cortext.net/analyzing-data/topic-modeling/) script.

> ## B. Research 

> <i>16,000 pig carcasses found floating in river that supplies Shanghai with drinking water (Mar 2013)</i>

> |**South China Morning Post**                   |**China Daily**|
> |----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
> | 100,000 copies                                | 31 million web visits, 200,000 copies in circulation|
> | "*Pig carcass furore still raising worries*"  | "*Water safe despite carcasses*"|
> | Reason for carcasses not clear                | Shanghai authorities guaranteed the quality of drinking water|
> | Government lacked explanation                 | Dead pigs were removed, polluted stream did not affect water |
> | Government’s publicity campaign               | Reason uncertain, but pigs were  young and  died of a virus|
